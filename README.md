## Introduction

---

This project was created in order to demonstrate and improve upon my skills with React, Redux, Jest, React Testing Library, and Sass. In addition, this project emphasized requesting data from the Reddit API and properly handling the returned data.

## Technologies

---

- React 17.0.2
- Redux-Toolkit 1.8.0
- Jest 27.5.1
- React Testing Library 12.1.4
- Sass 1.3.0
- Cypress <font color='red'>TBD</font>

**Note:** A live hosted version of the application can be seen here. <font color='red'>TBD</font>

Setup of this web application is straight forward:

- Download the repository Reddit Client linked here.
- Navigate to project directory and enter `cd my-app`
- Run `npm install` and then `npm start`. The app will open in development mode at http://localhost:3000.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Features

---

- Retrieve posts from hot, new, or top from Reddit homepage
- Click on post titles to see a detail view of the post with all comments
- Click on links to view outside articles included in posts

## Project Status

---

This project has finished development for now. The primary goal was to deomnstrate my abilities with React, Redux, TDD, and Sass. I felt as though it was more productive to move onto other projects and skills rather than spend any additional time on this project. If I were to continue with this project the next steps are listed below.

Areas of Improvement:

- Video player (Right now video data used from Reddit API is poor)
- Allow login
- Increased interactivity (save posts, add comment, upvote functionality, etc.)
